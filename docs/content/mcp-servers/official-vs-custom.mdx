# Official vs Custom MCP Servers

**auxilia** supports two categories of MCP servers: **official** (pre-configured) and **custom** (user-registered).

## Official MCP Servers

Official servers are pre-configured in **auxilia** with their URLs, metadata, and OAuth capabilities. They appear in a dedicated section on the MCP Servers page with an **Install** button.

Currently available official servers include:

| Server    | Auth Type | OAuth Method       |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| Notion    | OAuth 2.0 | DCR                |
| Atlassian | OAuth 2.0 | DCR                |
| Linear    | OAuth 2.0 | DCR                |
| Sentry    | OAuth 2.0 | DCR                |
| Stripe    | OAuth 2.0 | DCR                |
| Canva     | OAuth 2.0 | DCR                |
| Intercom  | OAuth 2.0 | DCR                |
| Supabase  | OAuth 2.0 | DCR                |
| HubSpot   | OAuth 2.0 | Static credentials |
| GitHub    | OAuth 2.0 | Static credentials |
| BigQuery  | OAuth 2.0 | Static credentials |

When you install an official server, **auxilia** creates a workspace MCP server entry with the correct URL and authentication configuration.

### DCR Servers

Servers that support **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)** handle OAuth automatically. When you click **Connect**, **auxilia** registers itself as an OAuth client with the MCP server on the fly. No client ID or secret is needed from you.

### Static Credential Servers

Some servers (HubSpot, GitHub, BigQuery) require you to register an OAuth app yourself and provide the client ID and secret. See the [setup examples](/docs/mcp-servers/examples/hubspot) for step-by-step guides.

## Custom MCP Servers

You can add any remote MCP server by providing its URL. Click **Add MCP Server** and fill in:

| Field       | Required | Description                                   |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| URL         | Yes      | The MCP server endpoint (must support SSE)    |
| Name        | Yes      | Display name in the UI                        |
| Description | No       | Brief description of what the server provides |
| Icon URL    | No       | URL to an icon for the server card            |
| Auth Type   | Yes      | `None`, `API Key`, or `OAuth 2.0`             |

### When to Use Custom Servers

- Self-hosted MCP servers within your infrastructure
- MCP servers not yet in the official list
- Servers requiring specific authentication configurations
