# Agent Configuration

This page covers the details of configuring an agent in **auxilia**.

## System Prompt (Instructions)

The instructions field is the system prompt sent to the LLM on every message. It defines the agent's personality, behavior, and constraints.

Tips for writing effective instructions:

- Be specific about the agent's role and domain
- List what the agent should and shouldn't do
- Mention which tools to prefer for specific tasks
- Include formatting preferences for responses

**Example:**

```
You are a CRM assistant for the sales team. Use the HubSpot tools to look up
contacts, deals, and company information.

When asked about a contact, always include their email, company, and deal stage.
Format monetary values with currency symbols. If you can't find a record,
say so clearly rather than guessing.
```

## Emoji Avatar

Each agent has an emoji avatar displayed in the agent list and chat header. Click the emoji in the agent editor to open the picker.

## MCP Server Bindings

After creating an agent, bind MCP servers to give it access to tools:

1. Click **Add MCP Server** in the agent configuration
2. Select a server from the workspace's registered servers
3. The server's tools will appear with their default status

Each binding tracks:

- **Enabled tools** — which tools from this server are available
- **Tool statuses** — per-tool permission level (see [Tool Settings](/docs/tools/settings))

## Editing an Agent

All agent properties can be modified at any time:

- Changes to **instructions** take effect on the next message
- Changes to **MCP server bindings** take effect on the next message
- Changes to **tool settings** take effect on the next message
- Existing chat threads are not affected by historical changes — they use the current configuration

## Deleting an Agent

Deleting an agent removes:

- The agent configuration
- All MCP server bindings for that agent
- All chat threads associated with the agent
