# Agents

Agents are the core of **auxilia**. An agent is an AI assistant configured with a system prompt (instructions), an emoji avatar, and a set of MCP server bindings that determine which tools it can use.

## How Agents Work

When a user sends a message to an agent, **auxilia**:

1. Loads the agent configuration (instructions, model, MCP servers)
2. Connects to all bound MCP servers and discovers available tools
3. Filters tools based on each tool's status (always allow / needs approval / disabled)
4. Sends the message to the LLM with the system prompt and available tools
5. Streams the response back, executing tool calls as needed

## Creating an Agent

1. Navigate to the **Agents** page
2. Click **Create Agent**
3. Fill in the agent details:
   - **Name** — a descriptive name for the agent
   - **Emoji** — an avatar emoji shown in the agent list and chat
   - **Instructions** — the system prompt that defines the agent's behavior

## Agent-MCP Server Bindings

Each agent can be connected to multiple MCP servers. When you bind an MCP server to an agent, all of that server's tools become available (subject to [tool settings](/docs/tools/settings)).

To add MCP servers to an agent:

1. Open the agent's configuration page
2. Click **Add MCP Server**
3. Select from the workspace's registered MCP servers
4. Configure tool permissions for each server

## Chat Threads

Conversations with agents are organized into **threads**. Each thread:

- Is tied to a specific agent and user
- Has its own conversation history (persisted via LangGraph checkpoints)
- Can use a specific LLM model (selectable per thread)
- Is independent from other threads with the same agent

## Supported Models

You can select a different LLM model for each thread. Available models depend on which API keys are configured:
