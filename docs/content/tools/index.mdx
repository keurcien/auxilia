# Tools

Tools are the actions an agent can perform through MCP servers. Each MCP server exposes a set of tools — functions the agent can call during a conversation to fetch data, create records, or perform actions in external systems.

## How Tools Work

1. **auxilia** connects to an MCP server and discovers its available tools
2. Each tool has a name, description, and input schema
3. The LLM decides when to call a tool based on the conversation context
4. **auxilia** executes the tool call against the MCP server
5. The result is returned to the LLM to incorporate into its response

## Tool Discovery

When you bind an MCP server to an agent, **auxilia** fetches the list of tools from the server. These appear in the agent's configuration with their names and descriptions.

Tools are refreshed each time the agent handles a message, so new tools added to an MCP server are picked up automatically.

## Tool Execution in Chat

During a conversation, tool calls appear in the chat as expandable blocks showing:

- The **tool name** and which MCP server it belongs to
- The **input parameters** sent to the tool
- The **result** returned by the tool
- Whether the call was **auto-approved** or required **manual approval**
